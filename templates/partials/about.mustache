<p>Free and guided workshops in Rust â€“ a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.</p>
<p>Our events are aimed at people who are underrepresented in technology and offer the opportunity to learn within a friendly, safe and sometimes fun environment. We do this by providing rewarding learning experiences, building helpful tools as well as materials and gathering a group of awesome humans. RustBridge is a project by the Rust Language Community Team.</p>
